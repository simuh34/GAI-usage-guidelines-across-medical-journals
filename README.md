# Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) Usage Guidelines for Scholarly Publishing: A Cross-Sectional Study of Medical Journals
# Overview
This repository contains the data and code used for the study titled "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) Usage Guidelines for Scholarly Publishing: A Cross-Sectional Study of Medical Journals." The study examines the coverage and types of recommendations regarding GAI usage among medical journals and explores how these factors relate to journal characteristics.
# Requirement
R version 4.2 or higher
# Main analysis included
Descriptive statistics of journal characteristics.
Statistical differences between the two groups were assessed using appropriate tests based on the data type. For categorical variables, Chi-Square tests or Fisherâ€™s exact test when cell sizes were less than 5 were used. For continuous variables, t-tests were used. Multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the relationships between journal characteristics and the coverage of author or reviewer guidelines. Linear regression were used to examine relationships between journal characteristics and the number of recommendations. All analyses were conducted using R 4.2.
